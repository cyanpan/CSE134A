                <h2> Hello dear reader,</h2>
               <p> 
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is XuanXuan Pan(Cyan). I am studying CSE 134B in <i>UCSD</i> now. This is my <strong> First</strong> website I will design for myself. <br><br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When it comes to Web design, I believe that commuication is the key to <b>success</b>. No one is the true hero when it comes to web development. 
                I discovered that social skill is also very important when it comes to web development. The needing of constantly talking to client is very necessiary. <br><br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, devoting myself into web design will be very beneficial for myself since I can further improve my social skill. 
                Feel free to play a beautiful piano songs on the left to enjoy the rest of the reading!

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now with the beautiful piano music, we can continue this journey! <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So let's talk about what I like the most. I like eating very much. I believe a happy stomach can definely increase productivity. My dream is to travel around the world
                and try different kinds of food. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And my faverite food is Chinese food. Espectially spicy food. I <b>LOVE</b> spicy food. China has a lot of food that is not spicy and delicious as well!</p>

                
                <p> Now what about the foods I do not like? I will give you a list:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shitake Mushroom</li>
                    <li>Shitake Mushroom</li>
                    <li>Shitake Mushroom</li>
                </ul>
